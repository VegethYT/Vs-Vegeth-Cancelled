VEGETH ENGINE by VegethYT 

If you wanna compile the engine follow the instructions if u wanna the exe download it [here](https://gamejolt.com/@VegethYT/Vegeth-Engine)

First download [Haxe 4.2.4](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.4)

Downlaod [Git](https://git-scm.com) 

After that download [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16)

Now install this [Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JT3EE7dJk9MKNzr2-YbojiMwJ23Mh4L2/view) and put it in the same folder as the Visual Studio installer and Haxe installer
(do not worry it is not a virus :|) click yes on all the things it says but not the one it says fix transitional camera bugs

Then go to cmd or powershell and do haxelib upgrade because you need latest versions of flixel and all his libs.

After that you can finally compile. Just open the command promt where there's the project.xml file.

Do lime test windows or lime test windows -debug if you wanna have debug tools

Then if you wanna build lime build windows
